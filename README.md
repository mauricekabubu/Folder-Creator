# Folder Creator

## Overview
**Folder Creator** is a simple beginner Python application that allows users to **create, rename, and delete folders and files** based on user input.  
The application uses **Tkinter** for the graphical user interface (GUI) and the **os** module to interact with the file system.

This project was built to help understand **file and directory operations** in Python through a practical GUI application.

## Features

- Create folders/directories using user input  
- Rename existing folders or files  
- Delete folders or files  
- Simple and beginner-friendly **Tkinter GUI**  
- Message boxes for user feedback and confirmations

## Tech Stack

- **Python** – Programming language  
- **Tkinter** – GUI library (including `messagebox`)  
- **os** – File system operations:
  - `mkdir`
  - `rmdir`
  - `rename`

## Goal of the Project

The main goals of this project were:

1. Learn how to work with the **os module**  
2. Understand **file and directory management** in Python  
3. Practice building **GUI applications** using Tkinter  
4. Handle **user input and system actions** safely  
5. Build confidence with **beginner Python projects**
